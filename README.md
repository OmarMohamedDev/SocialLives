##Roadmap
*Work In Progress*

##Notes
The Map functionality is temporary disabled in the master, develop and consquently the production version of the app due to Flickr APIs that seems that, in certain case are not providing anymore the geocoordinates of public photos; Working on a workaround in the version-with-map branch.
